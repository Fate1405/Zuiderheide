                    <p>
                        Hello all, I am a student enrolled at a school located in the Gooi, near the Zuiderheide. As this is an IB World School and I am (at the time of writing this) in MYP5, it has become necessary for me to undertake the looming task that is the Personal Project. The direction of this individual assignment should be influenced heavily by a student’s personal interests; so that they might remain perpetually allured throughout the extended period and perhaps be more inclined to exhibit industriousness. There are no guidelines regarding the nature of one’s topic, only that it remains feasible within the timeframe and challenging enough to extend the student.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interests have always been variegated and thus, in choosing a topic, deep introspection was required to make a rational, premeditated decision. The choice here was not a product of cursory thought, but rather calculated deliberation. The idea of building a website had been long in the making. My skills in computer science, although relatively novice, were nonetheless underutilised. Additionally, I always had a special interest in nature and its zoological phenomena. Thus, the notion of merging the two seemingly unrelated disciplines acted as the catalyst for my project.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subtitle is-3">Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        My research consisted in two main parts. First, the primary section saw me going outside to take photographs, collect samples for later microscopic analysis and chart the terrain for later mapping. The complement to this primary research was my secondary research, which focussed primarily on online sources. All information was compiled and made ready to be added on to the website.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="subtitle is-3">Product</h3>
                    <p>
                        The final product, that is, this website, did not come to fruition with as much facility as I had previously hoped. However, much was learnt during the process. For a more comprehensive overview in addition to the source code, check out <a href="https://github.com/Fate1405/Zuiderheide"> the official repository</a> on Github.
